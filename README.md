### Intro

Caddy is a super small npm package to make initialising repositories on GitHub much easier.

Without Caddy, initialising a repository takes at least X steps

1. Open GitHub in your browser and navigate to your profile.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Run `git init` in a folder on your laptop.
4. Stage your files.
5. Write a commit message.
6. Add your GitHub repo as a remote url.
7. Push your code.

Sounds tedious, doesn't it?
Well with Caddy all of that can be reduces to one friendly command.

### Installation

Install Caddy via npm using the command

`npm install @vanajmoorthy/caddy -g`

### Running Caddy

Caddy is super simple to run. Just type in Caddy in your terminal, provide your GitHub credentials, and let Caddy do the rest!

**TODO: ADD SCREENSHOTS**

### About the name

**This is very stupid**

Caddies _support_ you. Just like this tool does.
And the first _automatic_ car ever released was a Cadillac, and this tool automates creating a GitHub repository for you.

To be entirely honest, I'm very up to name suggestions.

### Can I contribute?

I would absolutely love that! You can submit any pull requests you want, any added functionality or optimisation would be welcomed. I was also looking forward to bringing similar versions of Caddy to other native package managers, so any help with that would be great as well!

### License

Caddy lives under the MIT license

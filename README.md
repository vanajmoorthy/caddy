### Intro

Caddy is a super small npm package to make initialising repositories on GitHub much easier.

Without Caddy, initialising a repository takes at least X steps

1. Open GitHub in your browser and navigate to your profile.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Run `git init` in a folder on your laptop.
4. Stage your files.
5. Write a commit message.
6. Add your GitHub repo as a remote url.
7. Push your code.

Sounds tedious, doesn't it?
Well with Caddy all of that can be reduces to one friendly command.

(Caddy can also be found on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanajmoorthy/caddy))

### Installation

Install Caddy via npm using the command

`npm install @vanajmoorthy/caddy -g`

### Running Caddy

Caddy is super simple to run. Just type in Caddy in your terminal, provide your GitHub credentials, and let Caddy do the rest!

Then you just input the your repo name and description.

_PS: Caddy even generates a custom .gitignore for you witht the files of your choice!_

### About the name

**This is very stupid**

Caddies _support_ you. Just like this tool does.
And the first _automatic_ car ever released was a Cadillac, and this tool automates creating a GitHub repository for you.

To be entirely honest, I'm very up to name suggestions.

### Can I contribute?

I would absolutely love that! You can submit any pull requests you want, any added functionality or optimisation would be welcomed. I was also looking forward to bringing similar versions of Caddy to other native package managers, so any help with that would be great as well!

### License

Caddy lives under the MIT license
